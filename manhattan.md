What if the emperor is not a specific person? Is it possible that Manhattan is the emperor and they are all children?

Each person comes to Manhattan for something greater, something they can’t achieve elsewhere. Julius moves from Danville, Michigan. Danielle moves from Columbus, Ohio. Ludovic comes to New York from Sydney, Australia, and both Bootie and Murry move to Manhattan from Watertown, New York. People say that if you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere, but why is that? New York City has endless opportunities if you are willing to look for them. This is obvious through Murry Thwaite. When he moved to the city, Murry started over. He worked hard, got his name out there, and became an extremely successful journalist. Manhattan is also extremely competitive as we see through Julius. Julius came to New York with the same plans as Murry. However, it is very difficult and sometimes you have to do somethings you hate before you find something you love. Just because you are well educated and come from a known family doesn’t make “making it in the big city” any easier. Marina has been struggling with her book for years, and when she finally completes it, it still isn’t good enough for her to get anywhere.

People will do anything to try to prove themselves and show what they are capable of in New York. In a way Manhattan is in control of everyone. Does that make it safe to say that Manhattan is the emperor? Can a place or idea control a group of people?
