      <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my webpage. I am currently a sophomore at New York University and I am super excited. I am extremely proud of this webpage as I am not very computer savy. I'm so glad I took this english course and learned about coding.</p>
      <p class="second-paragraph">For my final project I would like to focus my webpage and maps on Open City by Teju Cole. So far, this was my favorite book in the course and I'm excited to map out the different areas Julius went throughout his time in New York City. I think it would be fun to mark off all the places Julius visited throughout the novel and see how many I have also been to. </p>
      <p id="third-paragraph">I am looking forward to the rest of the semester and I can't beleive it is already half over! After being at NYU for months I can finally say I've gotten used to the commute and I absolutely love it here. I do miss my friends from my old school, but transferring has been the best decision I've ever made and I know NYU is the right place for me. It may not always be easy but it's definitely worth it.</p>
