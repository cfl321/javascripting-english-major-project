My name is Claire Lawrence and I am thrilled to begin my first semester at NYU. I am extremely excited for this course and I hope to learn a lot about New York City and a bit about programming. This is my first time using any sort of programming application and although I am a little nervous, I can't wait to a lot and show off my work to friends and family.
