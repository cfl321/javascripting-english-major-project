Do you agree with the idea that Marina, Danielle, and Julius could be the children, or do you think they are all children? Either way, who is the emperor? Does the power belong to Murry, a journalist well-known among Manhattanâ€™s elite? Is Ludovic the emperor, doing everything in his power to build a successful magazine the people of Manhattan will praise him for? Maybe the emperor is Bootie, coming to New York for the first time, attempting to gain power by exploiting his powerful uncle? However, is it possible that the emperor is not a person at all? Could they all be children living under the rule of Manhattan?
