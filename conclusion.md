Who is the "emperor" of this novel and who holds the power? Does the power belong to Murry Thwaite, a well-known author of the upper class? Is Ludovic Seeley the emperor, doing everything in his power to build a successful magazine the people of Manhattan will priase him for? Maybe the emperor is Bootie? He came to New York for the first time attempting to gain power through exploiting his powerful uncle. However, is it possible the emperor is not a person at all, but Manhattan instead? Everything these characters do is to make a name for themselves in Manhattan. They work to gain the praise and approval of others. Manhattan lights a fire in all of them to do something more with their lives. The Emperor's Children demonstrates the saying "If I can make it here, I'll make it anywhere"
